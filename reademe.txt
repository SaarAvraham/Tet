--------Question 2--------
We implemented light functions (without for's, while's, switche's) in the header, to improve the program efficiency (inline functions).

- Sounds: 
TO ACTIVATE THE SOUND EFFECTS PLEASE PUT THE WAV FILES PROVIDED IN THE PATH: "C:\\"


--------Question 1--------

Guidelines:

- Keys:
Left = 'a', Down = 'x', Right = 'd', Joker-Stop = 's', Immidiate Down = 'z', Rotate Right = Space Bar
The game is "Caps Lock Proof".
NOTE: We implemented move down key as the Tetris game in the given link has it (not to be confused with Immidiate Down key).

- Score, full rows and Bomb:
Player will be awarded with 100 points for a single row that has been filled with a regular type shape (Line or Square), 
but only 50 points if the last shape to fill the row was a joker.
The game rewards multiple row clears: for Double Row Clear = 300 points, for Triple Row Clear = 500 points and etc'.

Once a row was cleaned, any row above it will be moved one row downwards accordingly.
The Bomb shape will penalize the player for every cell the will be exploded. The penalty: -50 points for every cell.
The minimum score in the game at all times is: 0. 

Menu:
The user will have to press '1' to start a game. Once Pause button was pressed '2', the game will wait for another '2' to be pressed to continue
the game. NOTE: WHEN THE GAME IS OVER, THE PROGRAM WILL BE FINISHED ASWELL. (It was not implied diffrently in the question).

- Sounds: 
TO ACTIVATE THE SOUND EFFECTS PLEASE PUT THE WAV FILES PROVIDED IN THE PATH: "C:\\"

- Shape chars:
Lines,Sqaures are made of asterisk ('*') and Bombs are made of 'At' sign ('@').


Features:

- 'Next Shape' Feature:
The game let the player know what will be the next shape at every turn.

- Sound effects:
The game offers various sound effects for specific situations: Cleaning a line, exploding (bomb) and etc'.
NOTE: PLEASE PUT THE MUSIC IN THE PATH: "C:\\"!
(Otherwise, unfortunately, the sounds will not be activated)

- Random shapes:
The game generate shapes to create everytime a shape has reached the bottom of the tetris board or unable to move. 
We wanted realistic game as much as possible so we set chances for the shape 'x' to be:
40% Line, 40% Square, 10% Joker and 10% Bomb.

- Larger Font: 
To make game look visually better, we increased the font size of the chars it prints to the console Window.
Yet we still use the original 10X15 board size as required in the question.


We hope you will enjoy the Tetris game! :)
